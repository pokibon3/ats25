1. BAND, MODE, AGC/Attenuation, bandwith and STEP

    Press the push button, and then rotate the encoder to select the option.

    For example:

    * To switch the band, press the band button and then rotate the encoder clockwise or counterclockwise.
    The display will show you the current band.
    * To switch the mode (AM, LSB or USB), press mode button and then rotate the encoder.
    * And in a similar manner, you can alter AGC/Attenuation, STEP and Bandwith settings.

    __Tip:__ Try press and release the push button quickly. If you hold the button too long, the board may randomly alternate the command status (enable and disable).

2. SEEK COMMAND

    The seek button should be used to find a station. The seek direction is based on the last encoder movement.
    If clockwise, the seek will go up; if counterclockwise, the seek will go down.

3. VFO/VFO Switch

    To control the VFO and BFO, used the encoder push button. The display will show if you are using VFO or BFO.
