# SlametRadio 

This firmware is a project made by __Felix Angga__ during Covid-19 pandemic. This radio uses SI4735 with pu2clr library that you can get [here](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735)". The Angga's original sketch was modified by Ricardo to work with Thiago's KIT. The main modifications include: Seven Segment Font for frequency and display ON/OFF control. 


## Installation

You must first install Si4735 library first from [PU2CLR](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735) after that you must install the LCD driver. I'm using 2.8 inch LCD with ILI9341 driver. So you must install TFT_eSPI from Bodmer [here](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI). If you done all that, you must having no problem running my code.
